# 🚀 75 Days Kaggle Challenge – ML from Scratch

### 📌 Introduction
Hey everyone! Myself **Pathik Viramgama (Pr0fess0r)**, and I am on a **75-day Kaggle challenge** where I will **dedicate 300 hours** (4 hours per day) to rise as high as possible in the Kaggle rankings. 🚀 

This **GitHub Repository** serves as a structured log of my journey, where I will be **implementing machine learning (ML) from scratch**, moving from **basic concepts** to **deep learning**. It will be regularly updated with Kaggle Notebooks that I create during the challenge.
