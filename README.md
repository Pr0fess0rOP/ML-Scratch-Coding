Little Introduction before we go on. Myself Pathik Viramgama (Pr0fess0r) and am doing a 75 days kaggle challenge where I will try rise up to as much high in rank as possible in a total of 300 hours (4 hours per day). So upvote! What we are going to do here is to see what is the mathematical aspect that goes behind in Linear Regression with one variable. This is the **first** notebook in this series of scratch coding. I chose the easy method of formulas so that it can be understood easily. We will progress in the difficulty as we go ahead and will surely cover all the basic ML codes from scratch to the deep learning.
